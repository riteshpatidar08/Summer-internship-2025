What's the difference between push() and unshift()? What do they return?


Create an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and use splice() to replace elements at index 2-3 with ['a', 'b', 'c']

What's the difference between slice(1, 3) and splice(1, 3)?

Array Iteration Methods:

Given [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], use map() to create a new array with each number squared
Filter an array of objects to find all users older than 25:
javascriptconst users = [
  {name: 'Alice', age: 30},
  {name: 'Bob', age: 20},
  {name: 'Charlie', age: 35}
];

What does forEach() return? How is it different from map()?
